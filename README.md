# Comment Reference 

In this commit, we had learn more about lightening in three.js. We add ambient light and Hemisphere Light in the light.js

Change the return variable and see what each light actually does to the real time cube.

## HemisphereLight

A light source positioned directly above the scene, with color fading from the sky color to the ground color.

This light cannot be used to cast shadows.

## AmbientLight

This light globally illuminates all objects in the scene equally.

This light cannot be used to cast shadows as it does not have a direction.
