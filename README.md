# Getting Started with Threejs 

I am new and just started to learn with threejs. They are many ways to use three js. But some of them are more complex.

As a beginner i am using three with basic and easy way. 

Three js is an javaScript library to build modern 3D application in the Web Browser.

lets **explain perpective camera** further.

Imagine you're standing on the side of a long, straight road that stretches off into the distance.

As you look down the road, you notice that the road seems to get smaller and smaller the farther away it gets.

This is because of a phenomenon called perspective. Objects that are farther away appear smaller than objects that are closer to you.

A perspective camera in Three.js works in a similar way. It simulates the way our eyes see the world, by making objects that are farther away appear smaller. This creates a sense of depth and distance in the 3D scene.

When you create a new perspective camera in Three.js, you can specify a few different settings that control how the camera sees the scene. These settings include:

**Field of view:** This is the angle of the camera lens. A wider angle will show more of the scene, but objects will appear smaller. A narrower angle will show less of the scene, but objects will appear larger.

**Aspect ratio:** This is the ratio of the camera's width to its height. It should match the aspect ratio of the window or canvas where you're displaying the scene.

**Near and far planes:** These are the distances from the camera where objects will start and stop being rendered. Objects that are too close or too far away won't be visible in the scene.

Using these settings, you can create a perspective camera that makes your 3D scene appear more realistic and immersive, just like how our eyes see the world.

Try to fun by changing the value it help you to acknowledge you better how things are working.

In the next commit we will make our file structure more better. I have give you an hardcore idea in the code.
