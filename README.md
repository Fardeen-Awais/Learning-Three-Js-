# Getting Started with Threejs 

I am new and just started to learn with threejs. They are many ways to use three js. But some of them are more complex.

As a beginner i am using three with basic and easy way. 

Three js is an javaScript library to build modern 3D application in the Web Browser.

### **Understading the concepts of Scene, Camera and renderer**

#### Definations :

Scene is a container that holds all of the objects you want to render in your 3D world. You can add various types of objects to the scene, such as meshes, lights, and cameras.

Camera defines the point of view from which the scene will be rendered. There are different types of cameras available in Three.js, such as PerspectiveCamera, OrthographicCamera, and others.

Renderer is responsible for drawing the scene and the objects in it. It takes the scene and the camera as input and outputs the final image to the screen. Three.js provides various types of renderers, such as WebGLRenderer, SVGRenderer, CanvasRenderer, and so on.

#### Real Life Examples that a seven year old can understand:


Think of a Scene in Three.js like a stage or a playground. It's a place where you can put all sorts of objects, like toys, balls, and even characters, to create a fun and interactive environment. The Scene in Three.js is similar - it's a place where you can put different types of objects like shapes, models, and textures to create a 3D world.

A Camera is like a person's eyes. Just like how we see the world through our eyes, a Camera in Three.js defines the point of view from which you can see the objects in the scene. You can think of it as if you are standing at a particular position and looking at the stage or playground. 

You can move around to see different objects from different angles, and the Camera in Three.js allows you to do the same.

Finally, a Renderer in Three.js is like a painter who paints what you see in front of you. Just like how a painter puts different colors and textures on a canvas to create a painting. > 
A Renderer in Three.js takes the objects in the Scene and renders them on a screen or canvas.

It combines the position of the Camera with the objects in the Scene to create an image that you can see on your screen.

Here's an example: Imagine you are playing with toys on a playground. The playground is the Scene, and the toys are the objects you can put in the Scene. You can move around the playground and look at the toys from different angles, just like how you can change the Camera position in Three.js to see different objects from different perspectives.

Now, imagine that someone is taking pictures of you playing with your toys. That person is like the Renderer. They are capturing the scene and the toys from your point of view and creating a picture that you can keep and look at later.
